### Part I: Building a Compiler (25 points)
- Complete the provided buggy, unfinished compiler code. The work can be broken down into these steps, many of which are only a few lines of code. See instructions in full specification, as well as tips and an overview of the Jack language subset being compiled.
    - Step 1: Read and familiarize yourself with the provided code.
    - Step 2: Implement `src/AST/NumberLiteral.java`.
    - Step 3: Debug `src/AST/Plus.java`.
    - Step 4: Implement `src/AST/Minus.java`.
    - Step 5: Implement `src/AST/NotEquals.java`.
    - Step 6: Finish Implementing `src/AST/ArrayVarAccess.java`.
    - Step 7: Debug `src/AST/If.java`.
    - Step 8: Implement `src/AST/While.java`.

### Part II: Project 8 Reflection (5 points)
- Estimate how long it will take you to complete Project 8 on the last page of this
document. Keep track of the amount of time you spent completing this project.
- Answer the Project 8 reflection questions on the last page of the document.
