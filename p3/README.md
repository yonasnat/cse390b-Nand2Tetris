# Project 3: 24-Hour Time Audit & Boolean Arithmetic
Due Date: Thursday, April 14th, 2022 at 11:59pm PDT

**The full specification for this project can be found online at [https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390b/22sp/projects/project3.html](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390b/22sp/projects/project3.html)**

### Part I: 24-Hour Time Audit (10 points)
- Navigate to the Project 3 assignment on Canvas (linked [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1545384/assignments/7220418)). Download the document template titled `p3_24-Hour Time Audit & Boolean Arithmetic.docx`. Open the document, read the instructions on the first page, and **estimate the amount of time you think it will take you to complete this project**.
- Complete the 24-hour time audit and reflection activities according to the instructions in the specification linked above.

### Part II: Boolean Arithmetic (15 points)
- Complete the following files (in order) to implement each chip:
  - `HalfAdder.hdl`
  - `FullAdder.hdl`
  - `Add16.hdl`
  - `ALU.hdl` (the specification recommends three stages of implementation)

### Part III: Project 3 Reflection (5 points)
- Estimate how long it will take you to complete Project 3 on the last page of this
document. Keep track of the amount of time you spent completing this project.
- Answer the Project 3 reflection questions on the last page of the document.

## Submission
Submit Part II by tagging your latest commit as `project-3` and pushing the tag to GitLab:
- `git tag project-3`
- `git push --tags`

Once you have completed the `p3_24-Hour Time Audit & Boolean Arithmetic.docx` document (Parts I & III), submit the document as a PDF on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/379811) under the assignment named “Project 3: 24-Hour Time Audit & Boolean Arithmetic.”
